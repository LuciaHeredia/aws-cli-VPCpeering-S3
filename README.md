## Introduction:
This is a guide for creating a **VPC Peering**, launching **EC2 Instances** and creating a **VPC endpoint** for **S3 Bucket Storage** and uploading to it.

> The *destoy-script* is meant for deleting all that we created, with the help of a *.conf* file that stores all temporary variables (ID, ARN).

## Script Steps:
1. Create a new **VPC**.
2. TODO: Establish **VPC Peering**:
    - Create a VPC peering connection between the default VPC and the new VPC.
    - Ensure the peering connection status is active.
3. TODO: Launch **EC2 Instances**:
    -   Create a private subnet within the new VPC for the first EC2 instance.
    -   Create a public subnet within the new VPC for the second EC2 instance.
    -   Launch an EC2 instance in the private subnet.
    -   Launch another EC2 instance in the public subnet.
    -   SSH from the public EC2 instance to the private EC2 instance using the public IP or DNS.
4. TODO: Create an **S3 Bucket**:
    -   Create an S3 bucket using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.
5. TODO: **VPC Endpoint** for **S3**:
    -   Create a VPC endpoint for S3 in the private subnet.
    -   Update the route tables for the private subnet to route S3 traffic through the VPC endpoint.
6. TODO: Upload File to **S3**:
    -   From the EC2 instance in the private subnet, use the AWS CLI to attempt to upload a file to the S3 bucket.
> Note:  Donâ€™t create a nat gateway, the private subnet should only reach s3.
